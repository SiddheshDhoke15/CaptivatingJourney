						<h3><b>Cape Town, Rio de Janeiro</b><span>Travel</span></h3>

				<span><p><b>I’d always believed Vancouver is the most beautiful city in the world! </b>
						<br>It’s the only city I’d known that’s uniquely situated between mountains and ocean. One can spend a day hiking or skiing the beautiful North Shore mountains, 
						then enjoying a sunset from the sandy beaches of English Bay, all within a 20-minute radius of the city life of downtown.
						Then I visited Cape Town and thought it was a close contender to Vancouver’s natural beauty.
						And now I just watched this sunset over Rio de Janeiro and I’m realizing its breathtaking surroundings parallel those of Cape Town and Vancouver.
						Clearly, I hadn’t seen enough of this world. Where should I visit next to grow my list of cities that perfectly combine access to mountains and sea?</p></span>

						<h3><b>Venezuela</b><span>Travel</span></h3>

				<span><p><b>Goodbye Venezuela!</b>
						<br>Thank you for reminding me that generosity and kindness transcend economic crises and currency devaluation; that even in the midst of a dire situation, people are capable of staying beautiful.
						The origami frog and butterfly were made by my taxi driver using Venezuelan bills. The value of money has depreciated so much that the only thing these bills are useful for is an arts and crafts project!
						Depending on the day and black market, the frog (2 Bolívars) is worth approximately 5% of one US cent, which is more than enough to fill up an empty tank with gasoline, but it takes 1,000 frogs to buy a loaf of bread!
						But there is so much more to Venezuela than its worthless currency or political unrest. In the words of Ray Viloria Yoga Teacher, this country is more than the sum of its circumstances; 
						it’s the gentleness of its people and their love for their country.
						In a country where scarcity is so extreme that a person is lucky if they eat twice a day, generosity hasn't subsided!
						Traveling across South America for the last month has taken me on exciting adventures, but visiting Venezuela has easily been the most precious part of this journey!</p></span>

				<span><p><b>My husband and I just got married in Greece...</b>
				<br>My husband and I just got married in Greece last month, and we took our honeymoon in Vienna, Budapest, London, Moscow and Vancouver. 
				Budapest was one of our favorite cities! We found no shortage of great food, both traditional Hungarian and fusion from other countries in close proximity. 
				We found the Jewish Quarter to have the best food in the city, as well as the best Thai massage we've ever had! 
				Would you ever think that you would find good Thai...well, anything in Budapest? Surprisingly, Thai food restaurants and massage parlours were on nearly every corner
				in Budapest!</p></span>

						<h3><b>Lisbon</b><span>Travel</span></h3>

				<span><p id="onetwo"><b>Lisbon is one of my favorite cities...</b>
				<br>Of all the places I've been in Europe, Lisbon is one of my favorite cities. It is just so distinctly European - the hills, the roads, 
				the beautiful yellow trams, the buildings, the churches, the culture, the cuisine, the little old ladies who asked me not to take pictures of them. 
				I wandered around for three days with absolutely no plan, making stupid tourist mistakes and getting into trouble.
				On one particular evening after a long day of walking (20,000 steps and counting), I decided to take a taxi back to my hostel.
				I flagged a taxi on a not so busy street and it stopped abruptly to pick me up, followed by a little yellow tram slamming into its back. I froze, mouth gaping,
				but quickly came to my senses and fled the scene like a coward. I wanted to see what would happen, but knew it was just a matter of time before the taxi driver 
				would be pointing at the silly American girl who caused the accident. I quickly went to the next street and flagged another taxi, this time carefully making sure 
				there was no yellow tram directly behind it.</p></span>

						The beauty of Paris, France is absolutely astonishing.
						Few other cities in the world strive to shape the future while at the same time embrace their own history as Paris does. 
						I was lucky enough to explore the city for two full weeks. Enjoy!

						Getting lost in tokyo appeared to  be very easy given the enourmous dimensions of this megacity. This video features famous places 
						in Tokyo such as the busy intersection of Shibuya, famous Asakusa. Tokyo was by far the most polite and
						clean city we have ever been to.

						Philippines truly is a beautiful country. Besides the incredible nature the people are also among the kindest we have ever met. The 
						Philippines is also way more modern and clean than I expected. This video features famous places like Coron Island, Boracay, El Nido and capital Manila.
